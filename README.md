# Segments

Given: class [`Point`](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/segments/Point.java),
skeleton of class [`Segment`](src/main/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/segments/Segment.java).

Implement `Segment` methods:

* Constructor, having start and end points as parameters.\
    Ensure that created segment exists and is not degenerative, i.e. start and end of the segment is not the same point.
* `double length()`\
    Return length of the segment.
* `Point middle()`\
    Return a middle point of the segment.
* `Point intersection(Segment another)`\
    Return a point of intersection of the current segment and the given one.\
    Return `null` if there is no such point.\
    If segments are collinear, return `null`.\
    *Note*: Intersection point must be on both segments.

## Examples
You may use [Main](src/test/java/com/epam/rd/autotasks/segments/Main.java) class to try your code.
There are some examples below.

Sample code:
```java
...
double length = new Segment(new Point(0, 0), new Point(3, 4)).length();
System.out.println(length);

```

Output: `5`

---
Sample code:
```java
...
Segment first = new Segment(new Point(0, 0), new Point(4, 4));
Segment second = new Segment(new Point(2, 0), new Point(0, 2));
Point intersection = first.intersection(second);

System.out.println(intersection.getX());
System.out.println(intersection.getY());

```

Output:

```
1
1
```
---
Sample code:
```java
...
Segment seqment = new Segment(new Point(2, 0), new Point(0, 2));
Point midpoint = segment.middle();

System.out.println(midpoint.getX());
System.out.println(midpoint.getY());

```

Output:

```
1
1
```

---
Sample code:
```java
...
Segment first = new Segment(new Point(0, 0), new Point(4, 0));
Segment second = new Segment(new Point(2, 1), new Point(1, 2));
Point intersection = first.intersection(second);

System.out.println(intersection == null);

```

Output:

```
true
```
